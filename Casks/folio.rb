  # The install channel marker, which Folio reads at start: this copy is
  # Homebrew's. Written again at every install, upgrade and reinstall, since a
  # copy that drops extended attributes loses it. `uninstall_hook` is false:
  # Homebrew runs a cask's `uninstall` steps on `brew upgrade` and
  # `brew reinstall` as well, with nothing that tells them which, so Folio's
  # cleanup runs from `zap` only. A step list, not a Ruby block (Homebrew 7
  # deprecates `postflight`): `{{appdir}}` is Homebrew's token, expanded when
  # the step runs, not Ruby interpolation.
